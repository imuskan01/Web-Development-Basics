        <b>Hello</b>
        <p>The morning sky slowly changed its colors as the sun rose above the buildings, filling the streets with a quiet warmth.</p>
        <i>People moved through their routines with coffee in hand and thoughts already racing ahead to the day’s tasks. </i>
        <mark>Somewhere between the rush and the calm, small moments of peace existed—like the sound of birds on a balcony or the soft breeze through an open window.</mark>
        <u>These simple details often go unnoticed</u> <del> yet they quietly shape how the day feels.</del>
